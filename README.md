# Epicycloid

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js. It is a visualization of the creation of an epicycloide. You can also discover the nice patterns that can be produced.

## Side Note
You can set an offset to move the tracked point closer or more far away from the center point. Whenever you set an offset not equal to zero, the curve you will produce is not called epicycloid anymore. It is instead called epitrochoid.

## TODO

1. Make the controls more mobile friendly.
