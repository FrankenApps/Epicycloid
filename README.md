# Epicycloid

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js. It is a visualization of the creation of an epicycloide. You can also discover the nice patterns that can be produced.

## TODO

1. Add an offset so that epitrochoids can be produced too.
2. Make the controls more mobile friendly.
